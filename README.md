### App
This android application is inspired by the instagram feed. It contains a number of preselected images which the user can place a like on.
Additionally some userdata is logged into files on the device's internal storage.

### Usage
None of these apps can be used without this repo: https://github.com/antesberger/eyetracking-smartphone-mapping.
The execution of the mentioned python project puts a file onto the android device which serves as a flag allowing this app to start. To bypass this functionality choose the participant name ```test```.
